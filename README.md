Introduction

Fake news detection is a critical task in today's digital age where misinformation can spread rapidly through social media and other online platforms. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fake news using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, etc.)
Multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation and selection
Deployment-ready model with Flask API



Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled news articles. You can use publicly available datasets such as the Fake News Detection dataset on Kaggle or any other relevant dataset.

Model

The following machine learning models have been implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Results
The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and comparison can be found in the results folder.
